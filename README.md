# Swarm Intelligence
A program inspired by [Simulife Hub's](https://www.youtube.com/@wallcraft-video) Youtube Video on swarm intelligence. This program uses the HTML's Canvas API to create an implementation of the rules he outlines in his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu7sF9rcVJY) at the timestamp 5:13.

This simulation is also has a GitHub Pages site at the link below:

Also note that you can run the `enableBroadcastHighlight` and `distableBroadcastHighlight` functions in the DevTools console to enable and disable the highlighting of singals between cells, which can create a stunning lightning effect in the program.
